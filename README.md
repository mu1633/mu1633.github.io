Hey, guy. It was an honor to meet here.

In order to become a better self, 2023 will do these things.

1.Learn an hour a day related to the job, code quality and azure resources.

2.Practice guitar for half an hour or an hour. I love music, 
although maybe I don't have much of a musical brain. But it's really cool.

3.Reduce the amount of time I spend on short videos. According to the video site's annual summary, 
I did spend too much time on them last year. Most of them were pointless. Oh my God! 
I hope to reduce it to less than half an hour a day, except for the study videos.

4.Set aside half an hour every day to learn English. Communication is really important.
I don't want other people to be affected by my poor spoken English.

5.Cooking, yes, cooking something delicious is also something I like to do, 
because I think there will be a lot of times I need to cook in the future. I can't resist eating.

6.Last but not least, hope to meet my soulmate.




Thanks again for meeting you. This wonderful fate!




也许，在我们的人生中会遇见那样一个人，他/她突然闯入我们的视线，仿佛身上罩着一层炫目的光，一向自以为是的我们突然手足无措、自惭形秽，那种心跳过速是我们一生永远无法忘怀的悸动。
